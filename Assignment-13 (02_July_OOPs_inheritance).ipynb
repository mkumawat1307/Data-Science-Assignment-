    "> Inheritance is a fundamental concept that allows classes to inherit attributes and behaviors from other classes. It enables the creation of a hierarchy of classes, where a new class, called the derived or subclass, can inherit the properties and methods of an existing class, known as the base or superclass.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Inheritance Structure: Single inheritance forms a linear hierarchy, while multiple inheritance results in a more complex, diamond-shaped hierarchy.\n",
    "2. Number of Base Classes: Single inheritance allows a class to inherit from only one base class, while multiple inheritance permits inheritance from multiple base classes.\n",
    "3. Code Organization: Single inheritance provides a simpler and more straightforward class organization, whereas multiple inheritance can introduce greater complexity and potential for conflicts.\n",
    "4. Name Conflicts: In multiple inheritance, there can be name conflicts if two or more base classes define methods or attributes with the same name. Careful consideration and resolution are required in such cases.\n",
    "5. Language Support: Some programming languages, like Java, support only single inheritance, while others, like C++, support both single and multiple inheritance.\n",

    "|Single Inheritance|Multiple Inheritance|\n",
    "|------------------|--------------------|\n",
    "|Simplicity: Single inheritance simplifies the class hierarchy as it enforces a clear parent-child relationship between classes.|Code Reusability: Multiple inheritance facilitates greater code reuse as a class can inherit functionality from multiple sources. This can result in more efficient and concise code.|\n",
    "|Easy to understand: With a single superclass, the relationship and behavior of the subclass are straightforward and easier to comprehend.|Increased flexibility: With multiple inheritance, a class can combine the features of different classes, enabling greater flexibility in designing complex systems.|\n",
    "|Reduced complexity: Single inheritance reduces the chances of conflicts or ambiguities that may arise from inheriting multiple properties or methods with the same name.|Modeling real-world scenarios: In certain scenarios, multiple inheritance can better represent real-world relationships where an object can inherit characteristics from multiple entities.|"

    "> the \"protected\" access modifier is not enforced by the language itself, unlike \"private\" and \"public\" modifiers. However, by convention, a single leading underscore (e.g., _protected) is used to indicate a protected member. This naming convention is a way to signal that the member should be treated as protected and not accessed directly from outside the class or subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. Private: a double leading underscore (e.g., __private) is used to indicate a private member. This naming convention invokes name mangling, where the actual name of the member is modified to include the class name. Private members are intended to be accessed only within the class itself, and their visibility is limited to prevent accidental or unauthorized access from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 2. Protected: As mentioned earlier, the convention for a protected member in Python is to use a single leading underscore (e.g., _protected). However, Python does not enforce any restrictions on accessing or modifying these members. It's merely a convention to indicate that the member should be treated as protected and not accessed directly from outside the class or subclass. Developers are expected to follow this convention and respect the intent of protecting the member.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 3. Public: members that don't have any leading underscores are considered public. Public members can be accessed and modified from anywhere, including outside the class or subclass. There are no access restrictions imposed by the language, and these members are intended to be used and interacted with freely."
