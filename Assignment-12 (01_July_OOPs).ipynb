    "> The three goals of Object Oriented Programming are Robustness, Adaptability, and Reusability.\n",
    "> 1. Robustness :- we want the software to be robust, that is, capable of handling unexpected inputs that are not explicitly defined for its application.\n",
    "> 2. Adaptability :- Modern software projects, such as word processors, web browsers, and Internet Search engines, typically involve large programs that are expected to last for many years. Therefore, software needs to evolve over time in response to changing conditions in its environment.\n",
    "> 3. Reusability :- code should be usable as a component of different systems in various applications. Developing quality software can be an expensive enterprise, and its cost can be offset somewhat if the software is designed in a way that makes it easily reusable in future applications."
